# Hotkey
I created this little hotkey app, because most window managers have a sucky way
of doing things. DWM has a good key handling system, but i wanted something
more stripped down i can use with any generic wm


# Installation

easy to install.

    make
    cp hotkey /usr/local/bin

# adding hotkeys

easy to modify. Just open up keys.h and edit it. If you want your job not to
hang hotkey, make sure to add & to the end of your commands.

# License

This is realased under the MIT License because i reused code from dwm so i
might as well keep the same license
